Simply put, we're just students. This entire application was an English Project of ours. The English Project required us to make a product off of a set list of items all related to the book [1984 by George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four). My partner and I thought up this app and uploaded it to GitHub for all the other excellent developers on this application to see.

For those wondering what we got on it,
