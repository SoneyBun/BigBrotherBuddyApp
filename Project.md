# Rhetoric Project

### [1984 - George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_(1984_film))
1984 is a dystopian novel written by George Orwell. It was what we had to build our project off of.

## Rhetoric
- **Ethos**: By adding lines like "Endorsed by Big Brother" and others that show credibility.
- **Pathos**: Considering the state of Oceania, we can easily advertise to the population with this app that will make their lives easier.
- **Logos**: Tons of statistics and quotes from the book that make sense. The statistics in question regard app installs and whatnot.
